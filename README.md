# 2023-Graduation-Project-SYSU
## Research on Graph Neural Network Distillation Technology for Time Sensitive Scenes

This graduation project improves upon the paper "Graph-less Neural Networks (GLNN)" and was completed with the guidance and assistance of Professor Chen Chuan, Seniors Deng Bowen, and Seniors Yang Jinghua. I would like to express my sincere gratitude!

**Works of This Paper**

This paper introduces two innovations based on GLNN:

1. When training the MLP, I extract node position features for training, improving the MLP's ability to perceive node position information.

2. I distill the hidden layer features of the GNN model, enabling the student MLP model to learn the internal representation capabilities of the teacher GNN model.

**Contributions of This Paper**

These two innovations improve the prediction accuracy and robustness of GLNN.
